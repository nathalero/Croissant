    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>A croissant is a delicious French pastry, known by its crescent shape. (Croissant means crescent in French). Puff pastry is used to make this delicacy - the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded a few times, then rolled into its shape. It is then glazed with butter and baked. It is perfect served warm with some strawberry jam on the side.</p>

    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>

        <li>August Zang, an Austrian artillery officer, is credited with bringing the croissant to France when he opened his own Viennese bakery in Paris. (Some say it was Marie Antoinette who brought the croissant to France...)</li>
